# homeworks-for-studies
This repo contains some of my programing homeworks that I wrote during my studies. Each folder contains different project. In every project should be file `Readme.md` that contains description of project and how to build it.

### Notes:

* Code may contain mixed polish and english words. I wrote this code to pass review of my homework. Not to write 100% beatifull code.
* University of Warsaw in Poland has full rights to code in this repo.
