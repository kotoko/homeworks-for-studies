It was a short test during class (30 miniutes). Task was to solve problem and implement solution. Here is my solution.

## Problem

Given tree structure with with names in nodes find one pair of nodes/names. Depth from root of tree to the first node from pair must be equall to depth from first node from pair to the second node from pair. Both node names from single pair must be the same.

First parameter will be tree, second will be name. Predicate should check that name is indeed correct in given tree. When name is given as variable predicate should generate all possible correct solutions.
